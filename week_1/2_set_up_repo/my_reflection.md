*Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

Log into your GitHub account and you should see three tabs on your profile: Contributions, Repositories, and Public activity.  Click the Repositories tab and then click “New” toward the right.  Your repository must have a memorable name, public access, and an MIT license.  When you’re done, click “Create repository.”
When you go back to your profile, under the “Repositories” tab, you should see your repository with the username you created.  In order to add or edit files, you need a repository to exist on your computer.  So you’ll need to clone your repository.  
Assuming you’ve already downloaded the GitHub app.  You can clone the repository from the app or from the website.  From the website, go into your repository and click clone on the sidebar on the right side of the page.  In the app, select your profile from the sidebar on the left.  Find your repository and click clone next to your repository name.

*Describe what open source means
Open source is the practice of sharing how a program was made and allowing anyone to customize it to their liking.  For example, MS Paint is a limited software that allows you to complete basic drawings.  If you wanted to make lines with specific degree angles and length, you could never do it, unless MS released the source code so you could modify it and make that change.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Having an open source can give you the feeling of vulnerability if you don’t intend on sharing your code with the world.  Otherwise, share your feeling in code and others might share your feelings, too.

*Assess the importance of using licenses
Licenses gives the owner the choice to share their work freely, allowing others to change it how they see fit and share it with others.  Alternatively, they also prevent people from accessing it freely, sharing, or changing it.  However, if you want help and feedback, open source licensing might be your better option.

*What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I’ve struggled with the git tutorial and its Mac folder setup in the tutorial.  I think I understand the git tutorial for Mac, but I’m also a little confused as I’ve never seen folders displayed that way before.   
On a lively note, I think I understand what a repository is. In short, I think it’s like a location for your own files or data to be shared with others on the web.  Maybe a little like how Cloud would operate?

*Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
For IT terminology, I’ve been using WhatIs.com.  It was spur of the moment and I’m sure there are better online dictionaries for tech terms, it was just the first one I came across.
