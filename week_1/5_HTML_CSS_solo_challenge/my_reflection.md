* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

While I didn't ask any questions during this challenge aside from my peer-pairing session, I did you multiple resources such as http://learn.shayhowe.com/, w3schools.com, developer.mozilla.org etc.

The most difficult of concepts is trying the apply the right attributes to values.  Even reference sheets were a little difficult to use until the element, property or value was fully understood.

Given this was my first time, all I did was learn.  I can't explain all of what I've done other than I hope some good note taking and organization will keep me in the moment.

I'm fairly confident with the Learning Competencies in this challenge.  The only issue is time.

My favorite part of the challenge yet slightly unsuccessful was the float option.  I wanted to float my object to the right of the screen perfectly, but it was connected to the border of my container window.

The most tedious part was setting up images and directing the proper path to those file.  If I added or changed those files, they had to reflect in the html file as well.
