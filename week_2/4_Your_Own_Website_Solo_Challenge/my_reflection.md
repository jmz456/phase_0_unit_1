My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


I've learned that it's a lot harder than I thought.  Anyone can put together a webpage, and I thought I was pretty awesome for that.  However, design aand user experience requires a lot of planning before delving into that sort of project.  Although, I do love the idea of planning the framework and user experience.  It's a nice flow of practice.  Designing with wireframes beforehand really helped establish a good foundation.  I'm also inspired to start taking my own pictures.  Creating a responsive design for the end user is quite a challenge at this time given my limited coding skills.  However, without say, this is probably one of the most enjoyable experiences outside of work.

My current process is to work on a fluid website and understand how to calculate the pixel ratio to the size of different handheld devices.  What didn't work for me was getting images to disappear after certain screen pixel widths.  Also how to make text jump to the bottom of an image from its side after a certain width.  I need to review to get an idea.

The next thing I would like to change about my site is the structure of mystyle.css file.  I think there's a better and more efficient way to write the code.

The most difficult part of applying what I learned was keeping bad notes.  I have notes all over the place and I can't seem to keep one set of notes anywhere.  I need to gather all the papers I have and put together something more organize, and probably in word.doc.  I wouldn't say I found something super cool yet, but just time when things were super frustrating.

I didn't find anything on my own that was much help.  I've been using w3schools and it has been a pretty good resource at this point.  To see html and css code in action has been a real help.
