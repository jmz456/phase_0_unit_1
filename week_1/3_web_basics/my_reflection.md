## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Cascading Style Sheets is a new term for me, but I hadn't realized I've been staring at it all these years.  I always knew websites were made up of HTML, I've always known about domains and Domain Name Services.  However, the depth of these terms kept me reading for a couple hours.  The other thing I've learned is the simplicity involved with creating an actual website.  While there are no features, nor bells and whistles, I didn't realize something could be up and running so quickly.

If we were looking at a web site from a client's perspective, we would want returning customers, an appearance guided to our audience, the architecture of the sight, and something engaging.  However, from the back end, it would be important to know how to update the site, what features you would include or what code or language you would write.

Given my first impression of a live page, I was ecstatic.  The only thing I can't wait for is when do I start building?

Concepts were definately solidified in this chapter.  More over, how to operate git from the command prompt and update my repository.  Mostly web terminology what the most of my education in this chapter.

I've gone through youtube and listened to some tutorials on git and have a fuller understanding of it.  Most of this material were just words and I needed a really basic explination.  Searches on "intro to git" pulled up plenty of information.  I needed some sort of visual for understanding.  Many videos helped solidify that.
