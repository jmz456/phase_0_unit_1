## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

There weren't any struggles setting up git and GitHub, but there was certainly confusion for a short period of time.  Prior to the exercise, I thought git and GitHub interchangeable terms.  It certainly reminded me not to make assumptions and that being organized was essential.  There were so many different links throughout this repository that I needed a way to reference everything without getting lost throughout links upon links and overcrowding of tabs.  So I set up an origin point to track back to, so that I may work on multiple tasks.

So what is git and GitHub?  Essentially, one is on your computer and the other is not.  git is software on you computer that lets your track changes to your code.  GitHub is where you would send your code to be shared publicly or privately to a host repository or project.  You can think of GitHub like eBay.  You don't store eBay on your computer (your computer just doesn't have that capacity), but you can upload a file to start an auction.  git would be the eBay software you use to create your auction listing before posting it on eBay

As I mentioned that git can track changes.  In other words, this a part of version control.  Not only does version control management allow you to track changes to a file, it allows you to go back to a point in time when changes were made,  who made them, and provide a description of that change.

Developers use version control to keep track of changes in their code.  So if there's a part of a code that needs to be fixed, the user can go back to that time to fix the code.  This may not seem very essential for a user.  However, when there are multiple people on a project and sharing only one file, everyone can work on a portion of that file at the same time and upload their parts of the code without affecting the main file or duplicating that main file.

As I understand the capabilities of git and GitHub, I'm still not clear on what "pull requests" are, how does an "add" work and what happens exactly when you use the "commit" command (as I curiously stare at the green "Commit changes" button at the bottom of this screen).
