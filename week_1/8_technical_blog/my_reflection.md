Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

This has been an interesting moment to reflect on my own opinions and actually post how I feel about a product or service onto a web page that others can see.  I enjoyed the process, though it may have been a little tedious in parts, but I think that had more to do with wanting to type more of my opinions at a faster pace.  The process was certainly educational, but learning about it was thrilling in itself.  If there's anything I feel less certain about, its my ability to use CSS...but that's alright.  As soon as I'm done with the last lesson, it will be the next thing I do.
