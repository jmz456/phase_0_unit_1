2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

Hi Salamanders!
I’m James Miller.  A little bit myself (assuming this isn’t a professional intro) I’ve lived overseas the last 5 years.  My wife and I have 3 beautiful children that torture us with their versions of fairness.  Our transition from Korea to the US had left me without work for a period of time longer than I anticipated (I’d like to personally thank US immigration for that).  It’s been a roller coaster of a ride trying to return to the US.  On a plus note, I’ve loved every family barbeque since I’ve arrived.  Reconnecting with old friends and looking forward to making new ones. 

After reading a couple reflections, I’m discovering that I’m not the only person that’s doing this for the first time.  I’ve spoken openly to others in my accountability group and got some great tips on how to proceed further and faster.  I would like to understand how other first time programmers are feeling.  How are they handling their life outside of the program?  What sort of study techniques have worked for them?  How they feel in general?
I’ve been bogged down this week trying to understand git, github, HTML and CSS.  Did I actually learn all this?  The best strategy that I’ll be working on the next week is estimating the amount of time it will take to complete each assignment and setting up daily goals.  Designating time for study will be critical this week and more importantly, finding the proper place to do it.

A little on my learning style.  I have a multimodal VARK learning preference with strengths in aural and kinesthetic learning styles.  I learn best through physically performing tasks, listening and visualizing their outcomes whether receiving this input or providing output to others.   It’s more of a preference to me.  Besides, engaging is probably the more entertaining part of learning.

I'm a Concrete Sequential Thinker and I mostly observe the reality of the situation. Information needs to come to me in stages.  I can't jump around without being overwhelmed with other tasks.  In this event, I usually need an anchor task or project that helps prevent me from getting lost in other tasks, or digress from the project.  While this is the way I think, I know everyone's cognitive sense is different and I respect and try to understand the way others perceive things.
