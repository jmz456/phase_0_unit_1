## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

The design and user experience is an interesting topic.  Deciding what the focal points of your site should be just by viewing it in black and white was an interesting concept. It was more along the lines of marketing, understanding your brand, and how others need to perceive your brand.  I really want to work on my own wireframe and try to incorporate it into my own web page.

There weren't any questions regarding this assignment, but I can't help but think I may have misunderstood something.  Most of the skills I've used in the assignment come from the prior HTML/CSS lesson.  I've certainly solidified some basic concepts and learned to slow down and understand the code when something went wrong.  I understand how the code is supposed to work and so when something does go wrong, I know how to search for errors... on a basic level of course.

The most enjoyable part of this lesson was seeing the wireframe of different websites.  I've always wondered how they organized their structure of the page.
