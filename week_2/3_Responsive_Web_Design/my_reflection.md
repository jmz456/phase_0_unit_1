# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive Web Design is a way of writing css code to compensate for different display widths.  It's certainly a convenience from the user's point of view, but I've noticed some aggrivation with poorly made repsponsive sites.  When some users require more detailed or technical information, sometimes responsive designs cut out some important features or images users desire.  While it is good practice, a poorly responsive web design can deter a user from going back to that site.  For example CNET.com has gone to create a mobile version of their site.  However, they have too much important data and detail on tech that ruins the experience.  I rarely visit the CNET.com mobile site.  I always select to the main web page and turn off mobile features.

The change of web design to this new market has been massive.  The smartphone and tablet industry has provided another demand for design technology.  There will always be changes to design and development as the tech world progresses with new ideas.  While its difficult to say what will change exactly, know change, understanding change and embracing change with always lead to opportunities.

Just like anything else, the visually impaired can experience browsing with voice activated searches and text to speech software.  I recently heard of a tech that is starting to release vibrations on the tablet based on the section you press.  The electrical vibrations give off a textured feel on the screen.  If this development is successful, imagine feeling a picture, or feeling the border around some text, or feeling text.  Tech shoudn't have any limits with the impaired.

I think this whole process of Responsive design seems to be going a bit overboard.  I think as customers we get a little too picky of how we want our products presented to us.  As human beings, we're pretty spoiled.  However, understanding and meeting the needs of people is what adds to economic growth.  From one point of view, I think our demands and how we create demand is a little excessive.  However it's our nature and I have no problem enjoying it as I type away.

Treehouse has been a pretty good source of information.
