* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
--I can understand how a DOM is represented in hierarchy flow chart.  But what I'm not sure about is what the DOM is exactly.  I understand the tree structure of the DOM, but when I look for a solid answer, I always find a graphical representation "OF" the DOM, not the "ACTUAL" DOM.  It seems more like the relationship between objects in a file.  So In summary, I could easily create a DOM tree representation... but if you asked me, what's a DOM, I wouldn't be sure how to answer.  Otherwise I'm going to refer to it as more of a definition of terms that make up a model.  How confusing is this answer?

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
--It was highly depressing for me to learn that my coding skills have just scratch the surface.  However, it was really interesting to see the css stylesheets and the different styles applied to the pages.  Looking at the elements section really helped understand what parts of the code impacted different parts of the webpage when certain styles are applied or removed.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
--Chrome tools is all of this.  On the surface, it's certainly fun and helpful.  However, when diggint deep into searching for errors in the code I'm sure could become a pain to work with at first.  However, once in practice, it will be my new best friend for a long time.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
--Actually, I've discovered the elements tab in the past and was always curious as to what it was.  I didn't understand it, so I never played with it much.  My aha moment occured when I opened up developer tools.  Once I opened up the application imagine my surprise.  One of the things I've always been curious about was its purpose, but was afraid to mess with it due to the fear of not knowing if I would ruin some sort of settings.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
--I've actually been using youtube videos to help gain an understanding of a topic first before reading into it.  Getting a gereral feel for the topic, searching for analogies people use to help make certain concepts clear.  Once I have a visual map of what I'm learning, I dive in with knowledge of the subject and understand the material better.  The same applies to any class.  Prep before the lesson.  Listen in on the lesson.  Practice after the lesson.
