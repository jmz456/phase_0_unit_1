## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

As long as html is in a simple formation, it makes sense.  In most cases, simple web pages can be read.  However, once pages get complicated, of course understanding it becomes a bit more difficult.  All in all, the structure makes sense.  The most difficult part is CSS and how to apply changes to the html file.  With the library of options, it takes time to go through all of it.  None of the material doesn't "not make sense."  It's more along the lines of, "okay, what did I do wrong and how can I solve it."

While I didn't use any new resources, the peer-pairing session was actually quite helpful.  Max Diener and I were able to break down some html together and work out bugs in our code.  As I navigated the session, you drove the program.  It was helpful for me to jog memory and great that he could catch my mistakes.  The peer-pairing session was more impressive than I thought it would be and I completely underestimated its usefulness.
