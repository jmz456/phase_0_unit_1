# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The lack of web standards could lead to content that wouldn't be appealing in by, the shape of the content, the design of the page, data flow from html.  The lack of reusable code or that multiple forms of code would have to be written for different browsers.  The great benefit of standards is that the content can be found on any browser and it doesn't limit the potential and possibility of gaining access to that information.  Thanks to these standards, a larger world of possibility is attainable by everyone. 

The standard structure makes a lot of sense.  Not just for me, but I think for the end user too.  Typically, anything you build from the ground up requires a good foundation.  How you go about designing from there is the question of creativity.

I like the new HTML5 elements and I like how older parts of the language will still be supported.  I haven't had a whole lot of experience with HTML5 yet, but from viewing the different elements and labels, it seems pretty interesting.  Also, a lot of it just makes sense.

I'm not sure why reset.css is entirely necessary.  I understand that there are features in HTML that are standard in its default and i understand the reset helps eliminates those defaults.  However, I haven't really understood or seen an example to understand its necessity.

I've used Firefox, Explorer and Chrome.  My preferences are based on esthetics and features.  How information presented in these sites isn't a major issue unless there's a cost involved and how much of the information has been restructured depending on which browser youâ€™re using.

This site, http://www.w3.org/wiki/Introduction_to_the_Web_Standards_Curriculum , helped me a little in understanding web standards.

I' not sure why web standards would ever be a bad thing, but I would love to see a serious counter agreement if it could exist.
