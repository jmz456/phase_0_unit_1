# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge with Phase 0 is spending time with my family.  Although I'm lucky and I don't currently have to work, thanks to my old job, spending time helping my wife and children is my biggest management challenge.  I know what you're all thinking.  Guy doesn't work, how tough could it be.  Three kids is a world of hurt on my studies.  There's always some sort of screaming or crying.  Someone always wants my attention.  They have homework, need guidance and need time with their father.  The youngest of the bunch burns me out.  She's two years old and makes the Energizer Bunny look like a dead battery.  She's always getting into trouble.  Always problems, always wanting Daddy.  Don't get me wrong, it's the greatest feeling in the world.  Then my wife asks a ton from me.  She doesn't drive, so I have to fulfill has her demands as well.  Being home with the family while I study proves to be the biggest challenge.  Someone gets hurt, I go runnin'.  Someone fights, I go runnin'.  Otherwise, I'm stuck trying to concentrate while I study Unit 1 material.  

The only thing I can think of, which worked prior to Phase 0 was waking up early and splitting my day. A couple hours in the morning and a couple hours in the afternoon.  I'll start this schedule again tomorrow (at the moment, my baby girl is screaming for help).

I just tried a little meditation and while it didn't cure my exhaustion, it certainly felt like a weight had been lifted.  After completing my solo challenge, it really helped me to re-center and focus on my next task.   I'm actually thinking about doing it before spending some family time.

The first thing I plan on doing is setting up a small goal for myself: waking up early to enjoy a hot cup of java and some html, css, and ruby.  As for an overall plan.  I'm not really sure what to expect.  I know I need some time for review (now I'm being asked to cook steaks on the grill), so I'm going to look at a way to include reviews and exercises throughout my day.

The distractions are tough.  At one point I'm in the moment.  At another time, I'm ripped out of it and try to come back.  I haven't had a quiet time to do anything since we became a family.  Unfortunately, some sacrifice is required.
