## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
the add command is somewhat like a pool(the stage) of files ready for a commit to a repository on github

#### branch
this is a command that allows you to pick a previous or current commit and start a new branch which will allow you to work in tandem 
with the same code, so you could essentially show one part of the new branch and continue working on your master branch

#### checkout
is a command that allows you to toggle between branches or previous commits

#### clone
allows you to copy a remote repository and put it into a directory or path you choose

#### commit
a commit is a save point or snapshot of a file at that particular time

#### fetch
this command is like a git pull command except it won't merge from the remote repository until you until you use the 
merge command

#### log
this command gives you details of the prior commits with a description to file, who authored that changes and the time 
they did it name

#### merge
this allows you to bring a branched commit back to the main branch or combine a modified repository

#### pull
a pull brings files from your remote repository to your local repository and merges it

#### push
a push sends your commit file from your local repository to your remote repository

#### reset
a reset allows you to go back to a commit stage and bring that back to the head

#### rm
this command removes file from your repository

#### status
this is a command that tells you which files are have been modified or added to your commit

## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Reflection
The basic commands, status, add, commit, push, pull, log, fetch and merge are easily understood.  The difficult part is trying to understand what your code options are after a certain command (even though you can see your available commands with  -h ).  Now I'm not saying the commands are not understood.  I think I have a good general knowledge of what the command is intended to do, but it's the details after executing the commands that is taking time to get used to reading. 

While I haven't really found any solid resources, reading the reflection files has helped me to understand github from different perspectives.

While I don't really have a problem with concept, it's more about execution and practice.  The git exercises with "octocat" were quite tedious, but I'm guessing I'll go back and push through it.  

Two skills that I picked up " -h " and "commit -am' ' ".  The help menus are great for figuring out what your next command options should be and combining the 'add' and 'commit' into on command.

I'm confident that I can push and pull files from my local repository to the remote repository, commit changes, reset stages, and remove files from the repository.  The most basic of commands.  I'd really like to play with merging and branching and the commands associated with these actions.

The part I enjoyed most about this challenge is the depth we've gone into with github.  I've been using the command prompt from the start, so it hasn't been and overflow of information.  I think git should certainly be taught in stages.  Starting with status, add, commit and push.  From that point, using the pull command, fetching and merging.
